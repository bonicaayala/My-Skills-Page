            <h3>UI Design</h3>
            <p>As a UI designer, my job isn’t just to create something beautiful; it’s to understand the user’s mindset, predict what
            they will expect, and then make the design as user-friendly as possible.</p>

            <h3>Information Architect</h3>
            <p>I create structures that your users can not just understand but also predict – so people don’t need to go in circles
                looking for information and can learn their way around your product easily.</p>
